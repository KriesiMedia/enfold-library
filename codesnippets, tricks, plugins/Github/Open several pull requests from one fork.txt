When forking a repositiory and creating pull requests all pull requests are collected into one long commit.

To make independent pull request commits you have to use an individual branch for each commit in your fork.

Follow the following steps (Windows 10):

- Fork the repository on Github (= master, keep this clean, do not make any pull requests to this main branch)
- Clone this forked repo to your local machine

- Make a new copy of this master directory on your local machine for each branch you need (= seperate pull request you need) 

- Right click this new directory -> TourtoiseGit -> Create Branch
	- Select a unique name for this branch
	- Check "Switch to new branch"
	- Click "OK" (will take some time depending on size of repo)

- Use the source code of each branch to make your changes 
- Do not mix/merge the changes of one branch into another branch
- Commit the changes locally (make sure you select the correct branch)
- Push to your fork (make sure you select the correct "Local branch" and "Remote branch" )

- You can make multiple changes, local commits and push requests in each branch as you are used to do when using only the base fork
- Keep in mind: changes in the branches are independent from each other !!!

- On Github in your fork you can switch between the branches and create your seperate pull requests for each branch to the base repository

- You can delete your fork any time and the pull requests still will be available

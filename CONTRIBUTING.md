#Contribute to the Enfold WordPress Theme Code Snippet Library

This snippet library is a community-maintained repository and so contributions are always welcome.

## Submitting a Snippet

To submit a code library for inclusion in the library, please fork the repository and then submit a pull request

Guidelines for submission:

- Each snippet should be placed in it's own file.
- Each file should be named appropriately based on the purpose of the snippet.
- Files should be placed in the appropriate category (folder). If no category exists, you may create one with your pull request.
- All functions and classes should be prefixed with your own unique prefix, preferrably one that contains your initials followed by `ava_enfold_`. For example: `ava_enfold_{function name here}`.

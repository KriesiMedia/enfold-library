Video player controls within the Avia Slider are not accessible by default when permanent caption or slide overlay is enabled. 
The plugin works around that issue by running a script that dynamically interacts with the slider elements and switches them accordingly,
allowing users to access the player controls properly and play or pause the video slide. 


Additional notes:

The plugin works with media element players (mejs) or when using a locally hosted video (mp4, ogv etc), 
but due to certain limitations, player controls of Youtube/Vimeo or iframe videos will still not be accessible when 
overlay and permanent captions are enabled.
